v_0.1 --> v_0.2

New Functions:
- Check of the required resolution (1.2[mm/px]) based on input dimensions and the image
- Possibility to draw circular ROIs on the rectified image to calculate DUGR of luminaires which are not Rectangular
(--> Polygonal ROIs are going to be available in one of the next versions )
--------------------------------------------------------------

v_0.2 --> v_0.3

New Functions:
-	Possibility to load an image from a *.txt file
The number of rows is estimated by counting the number of line breaks
The number of columns is then estimated by dividing the number of total values with the number of rows
--------------------------------------------------------------

v_0.3 --> v_0.4

Fairly big update.

- The GUI has now 2 Different procedures implemented that can be changed via checkbox
	(Calculating DUGR on projective distorted and on projective corrected image)
- The Matplotlib frontend has been polished and the matplotlib toolbar was added to all of the figures
- A possibility to save the measurement protocol to a *.pdf file has been implemented 
--------------------------------------------------------------

v_0.4 --> v_0.5

New Functions:
- Possibility to load a parameter set from a *.json file for the projective distorted algorithm.
- Calculation of the DUGR value has been corrected
- In order to execute the calculation the ROI of the whole luminaire has to be drawn onto the src image
  (Only trapezoid ROIs are available, rectangular and circular postponed to the next update)

Bugfixes:
-	Fixed a bug where the polygon Selector didnÂ´t reset properly
-	Fixed a bug where the result table was overwritten with multiple entries instead of updated correctly
----------------------------------------------------------------

v_0.5 --> v_0.6

DOCUMENTATION NOT DONE YET!
----------------------------------------------------------------

v_0.6 --> v_0.7

- Option to only filter inside a rectangular window around the specified luminous area for the algorithm without projective correction
- Performance in terms of execution time improved
	--> Execution time of calculation with filtering of a whole image with high resolution (4087x1996px) down to approx 1 minute
	    (Was around 6-7 Minutes before for images of such high resolution)

Bugfixes:
-	Fixed a bug where a trapezoid region with a bigger width at the top than the bottom side would crash the GUI
-	Fixed a bug where the ellipsoid region selector was not selectable for the algorithm with projective correction
-	Fixed a bug where loading a new source image did not reset the old axis and resulted in stretching the image
-----------------------------------------------------------------

v_0.7 --> v_1.0

- The colormap for luminance images has been changed to one similar to the one which is used by the LabSoft Software from TechnoTeam
- It is now possible to change between logarithmic scalings for the colormap.
	--> This allows contrast enhancement in order to draw borders onto the image.

- A lot of Bugfixes regarding different procedures of the program.
Deviation from the sequence often led to crashes of the software before.
This behavior is now intercepted and a hint is given in the status bar.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

v_1.0 --> v_1.2.2

- Changed the Python script architecture
	-> Script splitted into seperate Python Files to allow easier debugging

- Ability to safe Parameters from the GUI to a *.json File
- Ability to load Result *.json Files into the Result Tab
- Small Bugfixes and stability changes
- Created an Installer for the GUI
-----------------------------------------------------------------

v_1.2.2 --> v_1.2.3

- Added *.csv handling for saving and loading the result tab
-----------------------------------------------------------------

v_1.2.3 --> v_1.3.0

- Changed Parameter Layout
- Added Camera Presets (Pixel Size)
- Updated Pixel selection for Ellipsoid ROIs
- Updated Area Calculation for Ellipsoid / Round Luminaires
- Bugfixing for pixel mapping
-----------------------------------------------------------------

v_1.3.0 --> v_1.4.0

- Bugfixing of filter width calculation
-----------------------------------------------------------------

v_1.4.0 --> v_1.5.0

Extensive update. Revised GUI, more convenient operation and new functions.

New:
- Separate evaluation areas for all 4 observer positions
- Automatic loading of TechnoTeam image series into the evaluation areas
- Storage of a complete evaluation project (TAR file)
- Handling of ROIs simplified. Now, one target image containing the
  defined ROIs is generated and used for filtering.
- Optimized parameters of light output area
- Plausibility test
- Completely revised software manual (German and English)

Bugfixes:
- Many small bugs have been fixed. Some of these have influenced the
  calculation results.
